Services:
Services allows you to organize  and share data/code across different parts of the application. these are used to encapsulate reusable,data share b/w components.

Singleton Pattern:
by default there is only one instance of a service. all components share same instance. we inject the instance into components
@injectable decorator  to allow to inject service dependencies
Dependency Injection:

Angular uses a hieerarchial injector system to provide services to components. it means that a service provided higher level is available to all

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ItemService {
  private items: string[] = [];

  addItems(i: string) {
    this.items.push(i)
  }
  getitems() {
    return this.items
  }
  clearItems()
  {
    this.items=[]
  }

}

HttpClient:
HttpClient is module for making HttpRequests. 

1:import HTtpClientModule in Module.ts
2.Inject HttpClient into a service

We will create the instance of service in constructor parameter

Services are commonly used for Http Requests.

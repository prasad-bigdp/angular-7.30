Forms in Angular:
Template Driven Forms:These forms are implemented and validated using html/template file
Reactive Forms: these forms are used to generate dynamic input field. these forms are implemented using ts/model/component files

Template Driven Forms:
  Each Input field have to give "ngModel" Directive to create FormControl instance(name is mandatory)
  Whole form uses "ngForm" directive to create FormGroup Instance.

  They provide some Basic Validators/FormControl Proprties:
  value: what is current value it is holding
  valid/invalid: these boolean values will be valid-true if the control has passed all validators
  pristine:true if the user has not yet changed the value in the User Input.then dirty will be false
  touched: will be true when user input has been touched,then untouched will be false
  Errors: erros is an object contains validations as key value pair
